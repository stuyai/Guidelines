# Meeting Schedule

<font color="grey">
 These are some general guidelines for meeting schedules, not hard coded roles
</font>

StuyAI usually has meetings at least once a week (unless there are vacation days). We will almost always have a meeting on Tuesday (where we will discuss concepts), but we may have optional activities. This club is low commitment, so it would be fine if someone couldn't occasionally meet here and there. Just go to the ones that you love the most. We will know about busy weeks, such as the week before the midterms, so it's OK if you can't come for a meeting then.
