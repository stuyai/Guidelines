_How this club appoints and impeaches leaders_

When there is an empty position, individuals who have attended at least two-thirds of all meetings and are interested in such a position in the club will be invited to apply for that position. Their application should highlight their qualifications, expertise, and passion for AI. A thorough evaluation process will be conducted to ensure the selection of capable and dedicated individuals who will contribute to the club's goals. After the current leaders have reviewed candidates, they will be invited to teach a lesson about artificial intelligence and will be judged on engagingness, quality of teaching, and overall impressiveness. After all the candidates have taught a class, the club will vote on who should fill the vacant leadership positions. In an impeachment case, a transparent and fair process will be followed. A formal complaint, whose template can be accessed by all club members, can be filed, triggering an investigation. If the allegations are found valid, a vote will be held among club members to decide on the impeachment. A club leader will need a two-thirds supermajority to be impeached, along with the agreement of the other leader(s). These procedures ensure that our club operates with integrity, accountability, and the utmost commitment to teaching our members. In essence, this club will run as a democracy.
